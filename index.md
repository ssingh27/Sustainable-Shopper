#What is it?

Sustainable Shopper is a mobile app that helps sustainability minded shoppers track the carbon cost of their online shopping and donate a corresponding monetary amount to a verified environmental organization to offset their negative environmental impact with a positive one. 
 
#The Problem

According to Neilson, E-commerce takes up almost 12% of all retail trades, but our online purchases come with a heavy environmental cost: according to researchers at MIT, something as simple as a single purchase of a toy from an online store produces at least 1.5 kilograms of CO2. The obscure and highly complex mechanism of the supply chain has become the new normal for millions of people. Furthermore, two important issues inhibit environmentally responsible consumerism or any meaningful large scale climate action: *1) Sustainably minded consumers today have little to no data on the carbon cost of their online purchases; 2) Most people who are conscious of global warming do not have an immediate incentive to donate their time or money to the cause of environmental justice.*  

#The Solution

A mobile app that lets sustainable shoppers track the total carbon cost of their online shopping over time, and donate to a cause they are passionate about all through a compelling, sophisticated and highly affordable mobile app. Tracking and daily reinforcement has been demonstrated to develop new habits and lifestyles. Sustainable Shopper is a lifestyle utility app for sustainably minded consumers with two core features: 1) Carbon tracker and 2) Donation Mechanism. A program calculates CO2 emissions for a selected product, and this data is then displayed in a manner of seconds to the user. This simple, convenient process gives users a high-level view of their overall environmental impact, encouraging them to manage their consumption and meet their goals efficiently. The app is programmed to recommend a monetary amount that corresponds to the userâ€™s carbon footprint based on a simple equivalency of $1 per kg of CO2. Users can thus directly contribute positively to high impact organizations, essentially offsetting their negative impact with a positive one. Launching Sustainable Shopper on platforms like the App Store will allow us to reach thousands of users, potentially scaling from individual users to a larger movement for responsible consumption.
