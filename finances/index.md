# Capital Need + 5 Year Financials

$52,000 is required as initial capital to generate revenue by late 2020 and $10,000 is estimated as interest expense. Sustainable Shopper will invest any prize winnings directly into App Development; while a current basic prototype exists, we require approximately $40,000 to develop a sophisticated mobile app to launch on Google Play or the App Store. Maintenance costs at approx. 20% of development costs and Data Analytics at approx. 10% of development cost will be incurred. Maintenance and Development costs decrease for each subsequent year due to increasing organizational efficiency and sophistication of the app. The Subscription model is set at $3.99 a month with the preliminary assumption that approx. 25% of installations will convert into subscriptions. This conversion rate is achievable because of the niche nature of the app and effective advertising towards the small but highly engaged consumer base; advertising costs will be incurred primarily through buying ad-space on social media (assumed at $800/month) and occasional sponsorships for influencers. For the same reasons, the current model estimates Installation Growth rate at 45% after the first year and 57% in the fifth year. We project that decreasing operating costs and high scalability potential of the app will lead to strong revenue generation. Future options like developing additional Carbon Tracking software and branching out of App Store to sell software directly to organizations instead of individuals will be explored after the initial five years and are not reflected in the current revenue projection.
