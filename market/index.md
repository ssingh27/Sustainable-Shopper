# Customers+ Market Strategy

Our target base is “Sustainable Shoppers” i.e. consumers who are engaged in a sustainable lifestyle. These consumers tend to be digitally engaged urban professionals in the 18-35 demographic. Neilson also reports that shoppers in this group are 11% more likely to shop online than the average American consumer. For these consumers, sustainability is a lifestyle; our users will use Sustainable Shopper because it is a simple and highly convenient tool for supplementing their lifestyle and improving their efficiency. The app eliminates the time and effort required to search for an organization and donate to it, by making donation immediately visible and exceptionally easy. Sustainable Shopper will reach this customer base through a three-pronged strategy of 1) partnering with environmental organizations; 2) optimizing on the iOS App Store and Google Play store; 3) launching an extensive social media campaign. We will partner with local environmental interest and activism groups to get initial user installations and analyze the data from these pilot projects to refine our market strategy. Through Search Engine Optimization and by optimizing for commonly searched keywords in the contents of the app, we will increase the visibility of the app in searches on Google Play or the iOS App Store. Finally, we will promote extensively on social media using hashtags, targeting sustainability focused Facebook groups and partnering with “sustainability influencers” (people who promote eco-friendly products on social media and have a sizeable following).
